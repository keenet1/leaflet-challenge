## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.

For this challenge, I have created an interactive map as a way to visualize USGS earthquake data.

## Tools
- Leaflet
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- D3

## The Interactive Map
The map displays the earthquakes that have been recorded by the USGS over the past seven days. Each marker on the map represents a recorded earthquake. The size of the marker is determined by the magnitude of the recorded earthquake, while the color of the marker is determined by the depth of the recorded earthquake.

The primary interactive feature of the map is the layer control box located in the upper right corner of the map. Using the options in the layer control box allows the user to select between three different map styles (grayscale, geographic, or satellite) as well as the objects that are displayed as overlays on the map (earthquake markers and tectonic plate boundaries).

An example of the map is shown below:
